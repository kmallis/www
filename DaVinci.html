            <div id="info1" , class="hide", style="position: absolute;">
                <p><b>Leonardo di ser Piero da Vinci</b> (15 April 1452 – 2 May 1519) was an <u>Italian polymath</u> of the High Renaissance, widely regarded as one of the greatest and most influential artists in history. His extensive talents spanned <b>painting, drawing, engineering, anatomy, architecture, sculpture</b>, and various scientific disciplines. Leonardo is celebrated for his unparalleled contributions to art and science, embodying the Renaissance ideal of the well-rounded genius.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Education</h2>
                <p>Born in <b>Vinci, Italy</b>, as the illegitimate son of a successful notary and a peasant woman, Leonardo’s early education was under the guidance of the renowned painter and sculptor <u>Andrea del Verrocchio</u> in Florence. He began his artistic career in Florence but later spent significant time in <b>Milan</b> under the patronage of <u>Ludovico Sforza</u>. Leonardo also worked briefly in <b>Rome</b> and returned to Florence before spending his final years in <b>France</b> at the invitation of King Francis I, where he died in 1519.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Artistic Achievements</h2>
                <p>Although initially famous as a painter, Leonardo’s <u>notebooks</u>, filled with sketches and scientific notes, have also earned him renown. He made groundbreaking observations in various fields, including <b>anatomy, astronomy, botany, cartography</b>, and <u>paleontology</u>. These writings show a deep curiosity about the natural world, though many of his scientific theories were not published during his lifetime. Despite this, his ideas and designs have had a lasting impact on future generations, shaping fields such as engineering and anatomy.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Most Iconic Works</h2>
                <p>Leonardo’s most iconic works are his paintings, which are regarded as some of the most influential in Western art. The <b>Mona Lisa</b>, his best-known work, is the world’s most famous painting and a symbol of art itself. <i>The Last Supper</i>, another masterpiece, remains the most reproduced religious painting in history. His <b>Vitruvian Man</b> sketch is often seen as a cultural symbol of the Renaissance. Leonardo’s works have left a permanent mark on art, and his legacy continues to inspire artists and thinkers to this day.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Innovations and Inventions</h2>
                <p>In addition to his artistic endeavors, Leonardo’s contributions to <b>technology</b> and <b>engineering</b> were ahead of his time. He conceptualized numerous inventions, including flying machines, an armored fighting vehicle, and concentrated solar power. Although many of his designs were never realized due to the limitations of Renaissance technology, some smaller inventions, such as an automated bobbin winder and a wire-testing machine, did make their way into practical use. His studies in anatomy, hydrodynamics, optics, and geology also set the groundwork for future scientific discoveries.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p><b>Leonardo da Vinci’s genius</b>, vision, and profound curiosity have made him a figure whose achievements continue to be celebrated. He remains an enduring symbol of creativity and intellectual achievement across diverse fields of knowledge.</p>
            
                <br><br>
                <h2>Early Life and Family</h2>
                <p>Leonardo was born out of wedlock, and his parentage remains a subject of some debate. It is believed that he was born in the village of <i>Anchiano</i>, near Vinci, though some sources suggest he may have been born in Florence. His mother later married another man, while his father married multiple times, giving Leonardo <b>16 half-siblings</b>, most of whom were much younger than him. He had limited contact with them throughout his life.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Education and Early Career</h2>
                <p>In the mid-1460s, Leonardo and his family moved to <b>Florence</b>, a vibrant center of <u>Christian Humanist</u> thought and artistic achievement. At the age of around 14, Leonardo entered the workshop of <i>Andrea del Verrocchio</i>, a prominent Florentine painter and sculptor. In Verrocchio’s workshop, Leonardo was exposed to a wide range of skills and techniques, including drawing, painting, sculpting, metalwork, chemistry, and mechanics. He became an official apprentice by the age of 17 and continued his training for seven years.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Influence of Verrocchio's Workshop</h2>
                <p>Verrocchio’s workshop was a hub for many talented artists, and Leonardo was able to collaborate with some of them. Famous painters such as <i>Ghirlandaio</i>, <i>Perugino</i>, <i>Botticelli</i>, and <i>Lorenzo di Credi</i> also worked there, which exposed Leonardo to the advanced artistic techniques of the time. Leonardo not only honed his painting and sculpting skills but also developed a deep understanding of the scientific principles behind art, such as anatomy, light, and perspective.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Renaissance Genius</h2>
                <p>Leonardo’s education and exposure to diverse fields helped him become the well-rounded polymath he is remembered as today. His passion for both art and science led him to become one of the most influential figures of the <u>Renaissance</u>, contributing significantly to both the arts and the scientific community.</p>

            <div id="life1" , class="hide", style="position: absolute;">
                <h1>Leonardo da Vinci - Personal Life</h1>

                <br><br>
                <p>Despite leaving behind thousands of pages of notebooks and manuscripts, <b>Leonardo da Vinci</b> rarely mentioned his personal life. His remarkable abilities and "great physical beauty," as described by the historian <i>Giorgio Vasari</i>, along with his many talents, sparked curiosity among those who knew him. One notable aspect of his character was his love for animals, including his vegetarianism. According to Vasari, Leonardo was known for purchasing caged birds and releasing them, an act reflecting his compassion for animals.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Friendships and Relationships</h2>
                <p>Throughout his life, Leonardo had many friends who were also notable figures in their respective fields. Among them was the mathematician <i>Luca Pacioli</i>, with whom he collaborated on the famous book <u>Divina Proportione</u> in the 1490s. Leonardo also formed close friendships with women such as <i>Cecilia Gallerani</i> and the Este sisters, <i>Beatrice</i> and <i>Isabella</i>, although he appeared to have no significant romantic relationships with women. One of his journeys through <i>Mantua</i> led to him drawing a portrait of <i>Isabella</i>, which was later used as the basis for a now-lost painting.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Private Life and Speculation</h2>
                <p>Leonardo kept his private life largely secret. However, over the centuries, much speculation has arisen about his sexuality, particularly starting from the 16th century and revived in later years by figures such as <i>Sigmund Freud</i>. His relationships with his pupils, especially <i>Salaì</i> and <i>Melzi</i>, were often described as intimate. <b>Walter Isaacson</b> in his biography suggests that Leonardo’s relationship with Salaì was not only close but also homosexual in nature.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Controversial Incident and Speculations</h2>
                <p>One controversial incident occurred in <b>1476</b>, when Leonardo was 24 years old. He and three other young men were charged with sodomy in connection to a male prostitute. However, the charges were dismissed due to a lack of evidence. There is speculation that the influence of the powerful <i>Medici family</i> played a role in securing the dismissal of the case. Since then, much has been written about Leonardo's presumed homosexuality, especially regarding its possible impact on his art, with some of his works exhibiting androgynous and erotic elements, such as in the paintings <i>Saint John the Baptist</i> and <i>Bacchus</i>, and in a series of erotic sketches.</p>
            </div>

            <div id="death1" , class="hide", style="position: absolute;">

                <h1>Leonardo da Vinci - Death and Legacy</h1>

                <br>
                <p>Leonardo died at <b>Clos Lucé</b> on <b>2 May 1519</b> at the age of <b>67</b>, possibly from a stroke. <i>Francis I</i>, who had become a close friend of Leonardo, was by his side during his final moments. <i>Giorgio Vasari</i> describes how Leonardo, on his deathbed, lamented with regret, saying that "he had offended against God and men by failing to practice his art as he should have done." In his final days, Leonardo sent for a priest to make his confession and to receive the Holy Sacrament. There is also a story that <i>King Francis I</i> held Leonardo's head in his arms as he died, though this may be more legend than fact.</p>

                <br>
                <h2>Funeral and Inheritance</h2>
                <p>As per Leonardo's will, sixty beggars carrying tapers followed his casket. <i>Melzi</i>, his principal heir and executor, inherited Leonardo's paintings, tools, library, and personal effects, in addition to money. Leonardo's long-time pupil and companion, <i>Salaì</i>, and his servant <i>Baptista de Vilanis</i>, each received half of Leonardo's vineyards. His brothers received land, and his serving woman was given a fur-lined cloak. On <b>12 August 1519</b>, Leonardo's remains were interred in the Collegiate Church of Saint Florentin at the <i>Château d'Amboise</i>.</p>

                <br>
                <h2>Legacy</h2>
                <p>Twenty years after his death, <i>Francis I</i> was quoted by the goldsmith and sculptor <i>Benvenuto Cellini</i>, saying: "There had never been another man born in the world who knew as much as Leonardo, not so much about painting, sculpture, and architecture, but that he was a very great philosopher."</p>

                <br>
                <h2>Salaì - Leonardo's Companion</h2>
                <p><i>Salaì</i>, whose real name was <b>Il Salaino</b> ("The Little Unclean One"), entered Leonardo's household in <b>1490</b> as an assistant. In just one year, Leonardo had written a list of his misdemeanours, calling him "a thief, a liar, stubborn, and a glutton." Salaì had stolen money and valuables multiple times and spent a fortune on clothes. Despite his faults, Leonardo treated him with great indulgence, and he remained in Leonardo's household for the next thirty years.</p>

                <br>
                <p>Salaì executed several paintings under the name of <i>Andrea Salaì</i>, though his work is generally regarded as less significant than that of other pupils like Marco d'Oggiono and Boltraffio. Upon his death in <b>1524</b>, Salaì owned a painting referred to as <i>Joconda</i>, listed in a posthumous inventory of his belongings. It was valued at 505 lire, which was an exceptionally high valuation for a small panel portrait.</p>

                <h1>Leonardo da Vinci - Artistic Legacy</h1>

                <br>
                <p>Despite the recent awareness and admiration of Leonardo as a scientist and inventor, for the better part of four hundred years his fame rested on his achievements as a painter. A handful of works that are either authenticated or attributed to him have been regarded as among the great masterpieces. These paintings are famous for a variety of qualities that have been much imitated by students and discussed at great length by connoisseurs and critics. By the <b>1490s</b>, Leonardo had already been described as a "<i>Divine</i>" painter.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Unique Qualities of Leonardo's Art</h2>
                <p>Among the qualities that make Leonardo's work unique are his innovative techniques for laying on the paint; his detailed knowledge of anatomy, light, botany, and geology; his interest in physiognomy and the way humans register emotion in expression and gesture; his innovative use of the human form in figurative composition; and his use of subtle gradation of tone. All these qualities come together in his most famous painted works, the <i>Mona Lisa</i>, the <i>Last Supper</i>, and the <i>Virgin of the Rocks</i>.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Early Works</h2>
                <p><i>Annunciation</i> c. 1472–1476, Uffizi, is thought to be Leonardo's earliest extant and complete major work.</p>
                <p>Leonardo first gained attention for his work on the <i>Baptism of Christ</i>, painted in conjunction with <i>Verrocchio</i>. Two other paintings appear to date from his time at Verrocchio's workshop, both of which are <i>Annunciations</i>. One is small, 59 centimetres (23 in) long and 14 cm (5.5 in) high. It is a "predella" to go at the base of a larger composition, a painting by <i>Lorenzo di Credi</i> from which it has become separated. The other is a much larger work, 217 cm (85 in) long.</p>

                <br>
                <p>In both Annunciations, Leonardo used a formal arrangement, similar to two well-known pictures by <i>Fra Angelico</i> of the same subject, with the Virgin Mary sitting or kneeling to the right of the picture, approached from the left by an angel in profile, with a rich flowing garment, raised wings, and bearing a lily. Although previously attributed to <i>Ghirlandaio</i>, the larger work is now generally attributed to Leonardo.</p>

                <br>
                <p>In the smaller painting, Mary averts her eyes and folds her hands in a gesture symbolising submission to God's will. However, in the larger piece, the young Virgin, interrupted in her reading by this unexpected messenger, puts a finger in her bible to mark the place and raises her hand in a formal gesture of greeting or surprise. This calm young woman accepts her role as the Mother of God with confidence, not resignation, presenting a humanist face of the Virgin.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>Major Commissions of the 1480s</h2>
                <p>In the 1480s, Leonardo received two very important commissions and commenced another work that was ground-breaking in terms of composition. Two of the three were never finished, and the third took so long that it was subject to lengthy negotiations over completion and payment.</p>

                <br>
                <p>One of these paintings was <i>Saint Jerome in the Wilderness</i>, which Bortolon associates with a difficult period of Leonardo's life. Although the painting is barely begun, the composition can be seen and is very unusual. Jerome, as a penitent, occupies the middle of the picture, set on a slight diagonal and viewed from above. The background features a great lion symbolising Saint Jerome, whose body and tail create a double spiral across the base of the picture.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The third important work of this period is the <i>Virgin of the Rocks</i>, commissioned in Milan for the Confraternity of the Immaculate Conception. The painting demonstrates an eerie beauty as the figures kneel in adoration around the infant Christ in a wild landscape of tumbling rock and whirling water.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>The Last Supper</h2>
                <p>Leonardo's most famous painting of the <b>1490s</b> is <i>The Last Supper</i>, commissioned for the refectory of the Convent of Santa Maria della Grazie in Milan. It represents the moment when Jesus says "one of you will betray me," capturing the consternation this statement caused among the disciples.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The painting was acclaimed as a masterpiece of design and characterisation, but it deteriorated rapidly due to Leonardo’s decision to use tempera on a gesso ground, rather than the reliable fresco technique. Despite its deterioration, the painting remains one of the most reproduced works of art; countless copies have been made in various mediums.</p>

                <br><br>
                <h2>The Mona Lisa</h2>
                <p>Among the works created by Leonardo in the 16th century is the small portrait known as the <i>Mona Lisa</i> or <i>La Gioconda</i>, the laughing one. In the present era, it is arguably the most famous painting in the world. Its fame rests on the elusive smile on the woman's face, with the shadowed corners of the mouth and eyes making the exact nature of the smile difficult to define.</p>

                <br>
                <p>The shadowy quality for which the work is renowned came to be called "<i>sfumato</i>", or Leonardo's "smoke". <i>Vasari</i> wrote that the smile was "so pleasing that it seems more divine than human, and it was considered a wondrous thing that it was as lively as the smile of the living original."</p>
